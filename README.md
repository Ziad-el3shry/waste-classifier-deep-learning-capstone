# 🧠 Final Project: Classifying Waste Products Using Transfer Learning

> 🎓 This project is the final submission for the **Advanced Deep Learning Specialist** certificate, offered by **Coursera** in collaboration with **Future Skills Academy** and **IBM**.

## 📌 Project Overview

This notebook demonstrates the use of **Transfer Learning (TL)** and **Fine-Tuning (FT)** to build a robust model that classifies images of waste into categories such as **organic**, **recyclable**, and **hazardous**. The goal is to contribute to sustainability and smart waste management systems using AI.

## 🛠️ Techniques Used

- **Transfer Learning** with pre-trained models (e.g., MobileNet, VGG, etc.)
- **Fine-Tuning** layers for domain adaptation
- **Data Augmentation** for generalization
- **Model Evaluation** using accuracy and loss curves
- **Confusion Matrix** for detailed class-wise performance
- **TensorFlow / Keras** for deep learning implementation

## 📂 Dataset

- The dataset consists of labeled images of waste materials.
- Preprocessed and augmented using `ImageDataGenerator` to balance classes and improve model performance.

## 🚀 Results

- Achieved high classification accuracy using a fine-tuned TL model.
- Demonstrated effective generalization on unseen validation data.
- Showcased the power of reusing pre-trained models to solve real-world problems with limited data.
